    <h2 class="section-title">About</h2>

<h3>Background</h3>
<p>In 2015 Dr Colleen Henning arranged for Peter Bohacek to visit South Africa and
run workshops on Direct Measurement Videos. We used the visit as an opportunity
to run a conference and workshop in Johannesburg and Cape Town. To make the
event comprehensive we included a number of talks related to not only the
teaching of physics but also about education in general. There was overwhelming
feedback that it should be an annual event.</p>


<h3>Goal</h3>
<p>We want to bring together like-minded teachers who want to be
part of building a strong community of practitioners that actively engage in
sharing ideas and learning more about physics education research, how best to teach
physics, current trends in physics, the impact of physics in society and the careers that are accessible
to physicists.</p>

<h3>2016 - Computational Physics</h3>
<p>This year we have a more of a theme but we have worked hard to keep the balance
between classroom-focused, hands-on workshops and more general talks.</p>

<p>Our theme for 2016 is computational
physics (fear not, <strong>no</strong> programming experience required!). All of the speakers are passionate about physics education, not just
physics, and the talks are aimed at high school teachers.</p>

<p>Technology is playing a larger part of of our lives, and devices are making
their way into our classrooms. As teachers, we need to find ways to use
technology to enable learning just as technology enables physicists at all
levels to create, test and explore models; visualise systems and processes; and
solve problems that don't yet have analytical solutions. </p>

<p>Computers are more than just fancy calculators. They are tools that are
becoming a fundamental part of doing physics. They enable physicists at all
levels to create, test and explore models; visualise systems and processes; and
solve problems that don't yet have analytical solutions.</p>

<p>Our line-up includes a hands-on workshop from Rhett Allain that will introduce
us to easy-to-use tools to bring computational physics and visualisations into
the classroom. </p>

<p>We'll build on this with Trisha Salagaram talking about how
computational physics has become a pillar of modern physics and her research on how it needs to be integrated into undergraduate physics. </p>

<p>To extend our awareness of new physics research
we'll move beyond the school and university classrooms and learn about some
really exciting, cutting-edge research into galaxies that uses computational
techniques for simulations from Romeel Davé. </p>

<p>Physicists learn
analytical-, quantitative- and technical skills that are widely applicable. 
Carolina Ödman-Govender will talk about how being a physicist has enabled her
to  move out of academia into an exciting financial
technology company. </p>

<p>Keeping up with the developments in Physics Education Research, like the
emphasis on the
integration of computational physics and visualisation into the classroom, will
lead us into the talk by
Saalih Allie on other topics that are emerging in PER of which we should be
aware.  This is an opportunity to reflect on teaching practices and be guided
by evidence of what is effective in classrooms worldwide.</p>

<p>We'll wrap up with an exploration of some learning strategies integrated
into the teaching of electric circuits with Megan Beckett and Adam Reynolds.</p>

<p>In between all of that, we'll have a spit braai, an update on the latest
results on exoplanets by Kosma von Maltitz and spend an evening
observing the night sky with the local amateur astronomers.</p>

        <p class="speakers-bio">Colleen began her career in particle physics. While tutoring university students and teaching part-time as a postgraduate, she discovered her talent for teaching and her love of making a difference to others. As a science teacher in South Africa, she works with students from all kinds of backgrounds and makes a point of teaching tolerance in her classes by encouraging group work and discussions. Her students receive awards at international science fairs. One student team won the CERN Beam Line for Schools competition and was invited to conduct experiments on site at CERN. Colleen is very active in online communities and has authored open source text books. She shares her teaching materials and experience. She organised the first South African physics teacher conference in 2015 and is working towards founding an association of science teachers. She has also contributed to textbooks which are distributed free of charge to public schools in South Africa.</p>

        <h3 class="speakers-name">Dr Ismail Akhalwaya <a href="http://researcher.ibm.com/researcher/view.php?person=za-IsmailA" title="IBM profile">IBM profile</a></h3>
        <p class="speakers-bio">Ismail obtained his B.Sc. Mathematics, Physics and Computer Science (2003) and his B.Sc. Honours Mathematics of Computer Science with Physics (2004) from UCT on the beautiful foothills of Table Mountain. He then joined the Quantum Research Group (QRG) at the balmy UKZN for his M.Sc. Theoretical Physics (Quantum Computation &amp; Information, 2006, awarded cum laude with the S2A3 Bronze Medal). Ismail was then fortunate to be awarded a Canon Collins-Mamphela Rampele Scholarship for a one year studentship (non-credit course work &amp; intensive research) at the Centre for Quantum Computation, Department of Applied Mathematics and Theoretical Physics, University of Cambridge in the perpetually overcast UK. After much soul-searching, Ismail completed his Ph.D. Theoretical Physics (Classical Noise in Quantum Systems, 2014) at the QRG, UKZN.At IBM Research Ismail is engaged with three primary tasks: engage in fundamental SKA physics/astronomy research especially through a machine-learning lens, explore quantum information research and supervise/co-supervise Wits postgraduate students. To faciliate the latter the University of the Witwatersrand has appointed Ismail as a Visiting Lecturer in the School of Computer Science and Applied Mathematics. On the SKA front, Ismail has forged ties with a number of SKA researchers and is currently working on Bayesian Interferometry and Unsupervised Machine Learning.            </p>

              <td class="schedule-description">Computational physics is an established method of conducting physics research where problems are solved on a computer. It allows researchers to study phenomena that are not easily or completely studied by theoretical or experimental means. In addition computational physics is a valuable pedagogical tool which has been shown to enhance students understanding on physics concepts. Computational physics education research is a relatively new field of research. My interest lies in developing computational paradigms to enhance the understanding of physics at undergraduate level at tertiary institutions and at high school level. At the undergraduate level this entails translating current physics research in advanced topics to simplified physics problems that can be solved on the computer in the classroom. At high school level my interest lies in developing simple physics problems relevant to the national physical science curriculum, from which students must create interactive simulations through Easy Java Simulations (Ejs). In this talk I will give an overview of computational physics in South African and its relevance to Science, particularly in the African context. I will also present the results from my research projects in computational physics education.</td>

              Quantum Computers as Quantum Simulators

              </td>
              <td class="schedule-description">In the 20th century the scientific method received an upgrade: computation. Computation has become a third pillar that facilitates both theory generation and physical experimentation. Computers are used to help understand theoretical models, to crunch experimental data and even partially replace experiment with simulations. Now, in the 21st century, computation is about to receive an exponential upgrade: quantum computation. In this talk, we briefly introduce the quantum physics underlying quantum computers and how quantum computers allow us to simulate quantum physics and as a nefarious aside, crack the encryption lock in your internet browser!</td>

Some specific concepts in electric circuits theory (e.g. potential difference; emf and internal resistance; resistance) will be included as discussion points. The purpose of including specific topics is not to teach any content, but rather to discuss how we teach the content. What analogies do we use? How do we sequence the concepts? What are the potential advantages and disadvantages that result from any particular decision we make? This workshop will be very much hands-on and interactive.</td>
