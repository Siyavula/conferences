    <h2 class="section-title">About</h2>

<h3>Background</h3>
<p>In 2015 Dr Colleen Henning arranged for Peter Bohacek to visit South Africa and
run workshops on Direct Measurement Videos. We used the visit as an opportunity
to run a conference and workshop in Johannesburg and Cape Town. To make the
event comprehensive we included a number of talks related to not only the
teaching of physics but also about education in general. There was overwhelming
feedback that it should be an annual event.</p>


<h3>Goal</h3>
<p>We want to bring together like-minded educators who want to be
part of building a strong community of practitioners that actively engage in
sharing ideas and learning more about physics research, how best to teach
physics, the impact of physics in society and the careers that are accessible
to physicists.</p>

<h3>2016 - Computational Physics</h3>
<p>This year we have a more of a theme but have worked hard to keep the balance
between classroom-focused, hands-on workshops and more general talks.</p>

<p>Our theme, fear not - <strong>NO programming experience</strong> required, is computational
physics. All of the speakers are passionate about physics education, not just
physics, and the talks are aimed at high school teachers.</p>

<p>Computers are more than just fancy calculators, they are tools that are
becoming a fundamental part of doing physics - they enable physicists at all
levels to create, test and explore models; visualise systems and processes; and
solve problems that don't yet have analytical solutions.</p>

<p>Our line-up includes a hands-on workshop from Rhett Allain that will introduce
us to easy-to-use tools to bring computational physics and visualisations into
the classroom. </p>

<p>We'll build on this with Trisha Salagaram talking about how
computational physics has become a pillar of modern physics and her work on
researching how it needs to be integrated into undergraduate physics. </p>

<p>To extend our awareness of new physics research
we'll move beyond the school and university classrooms and learn about some
really exciting, cutting-edge research into galaxies that uses computational
techniques for simulations from Romeel Davé. </p>

<p>Physicists learn
analytical-, quantitative- and technical skills that are widely applicable and
Carolina Ödman-Govender will talk about how being a physicist has enabled her
to  move out of academia into an exciting financial
technology company. </p>

<p>Keeping up with the developments in Physics Education Research, like the
emphasis on the
integration of computational physics and visualisation, leads into the talk by
Saalih Allie on what other topics are emerging that in PER that we should be
aware of.</p>

<p>We'll wrap up with a summary of some of the more emergent techniques that are
being used in education by Megan Beckett but specifically integrated into the teaching
of electric circuits by Adam Reynolds.</p>

<p>In between all of that, we'll have a spit braai, an update on the latest
results on exoplanets by Kosma von Maltitz and spend another evening
observing.</p>

        <p class="speakers-bio">Colleen began her career in particle physics. While tutoring university students and teaching part-time as a postgraduate, she discovered her talent for teaching and her love of making a difference to others. As a science teacher in South Africa, she works with students from all kinds of backgrounds and makes a point of teaching tolerance in her classes by encouraging group work and discussions. Her students receive awards at international science fairs. One student team won the CERN Beam Line for Schools competition and was invited to conduct experiments on site at CERN. Colleen is very active in online communities and has authored open source text books. She shares her teaching materials and experience. She organised the first South African physics teacher conference in 2015 and is working towards founding an association of science teachers. She has also contributed to textbooks which are distributed free of charge to public schools in South Africa.</p>

        <p class="speakers-bio">I was born in California and grew up mostly in the U.S. with a few early years in India.  I received my bachelor’s in Physics from Berkeley, a Master’s in Physics from Caltech, and a Ph.D. in Astronomy from U.C. Santa Cruz.  I was awarded a Lyman Spitzer postdoctoral fellowship at Princeton, followed by a Hubble Fellowship that I took to the University of Arizona.  After three years I was demoted to faculty at Arizona, where I remained for 9 years until moving to Cape Town in 2013.  I am now the South African Research Chair in Cosmology with Multi-wavelength Data, which I split between the University of the Western Cape, and the South African Astronomical Observatories, and the African Institute for Mathematical Sciences.  I study computational galaxy formation and cosmology, which is one of the fastest-growing areas of astrophysics in the world today.  My research aims to answer a fundamental question of our existence: Why does the Universe look the way it does?</p>

        <p class="speakers-bio">Rhett Allain is an associate professor of physics at Southeastern Louisiana University and the author of the Wired magazine science blog Dot Physics. He received his Ph.D. from North Carolina State University in 2001 and works in the field of physics education research. In his blog, Dot Physics, Allain discusses physical concepts, answers questions related to physics and math, and debunks questionable physical claims. Many of his posts are supported by experiments, calculations and models. Recently, he has analyzed the physics behind the Angry Birds Space video game and behind a now-debunked video which purported to show a man flying with home-made wings. He has also criticized television shows, including Fight Science, that perform poorly controlled experiments which are presented as scientific.</p>
